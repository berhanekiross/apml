Q3.3

We want to compute \( p(t > 0) \). Since \( t \) is a Gaussian random variable with mean \( \mu_t \) and variance \( \sigma_t^2 \), the probability can be found using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution.

First, for any Gaussian random variable \( t \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_t, \sigma_t^2) \), the probability that \( t \) is less than or equal to a value \( a \) is given by the CDF \( \Phi \) of the standard normal distribution:

\[
p(t \leq a) = \Phi\left( \frac{a - \mu_t}{\sigma_t} \right)
\]

In our case, we want to find \( p(t > 0) \). This can be written as:

\[
p(t > 0) = 1 - p(t \leq 0)
\]

Using the CDF of the normal distribution, we have:

\[
p(t \leq 0) = \Phi\left( \frac{0 - \mu_t}{\sigma_t} \right) = \Phi\left( \frac{-\mu_t}{\sigma_t} \right)
\]

Therefore, the probability that \( t > 0 \) is:

\[
p(t > 0) = 1 - \Phi\left( \frac{-\mu_t}{\sigma_t} \right)
\]

This avoids the need for explicit integration. Instead, we use the known properties of the normal distribution, where \( \Phi \) is the CDF of the standard normal distribution, and the result is computed directly.

Finally, in the context of the problem where we are computing the probability \( p(y = 1) \) that Player 1 wins, the mean \( \mu_t \) and variance \( \sigma_t^2 \) are derived from the skills \( \mu_1 \) and \( \mu_2 \), and their respective variances \( \sigma_1^2 \), \( \sigma_2^2 \), along with the variance \( \sigma_\epsilon^2 \) from the noise model. The final result is:

\[
p(y = 1) = 1 - \Phi\left( \frac{-(\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{\sqrt{\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2 + \sigma_\epsilon^2}} \right)
\]
